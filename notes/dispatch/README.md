# `notes/dispatch/`

Editable slice prompts for main-agent dispatch. One file per slice. Each
file is meant to be opened, tweaked, and copy-pasted into a fresh main
agent session. Treat them as living - if a slice evolves mid-session,
edit the file, do not let the drift live only in your head.

## Convention

- Filename: `<slice_id>_<short_name>.md` (e.g. `P1_planner_cleanup.md`).
- Slice IDs map 1:1 to rows in `notes/CP9_ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`.
- Each file has: `Slice`, `Role`, `Preconditions`, `Outcome`, `Boundaries`,
  `Acceptance`, `Delegation hints`, `Report format`.
- Role is always "main agent (`gpt-5.4 xhigh`)" unless we are explicitly
  dispatching a scout or worker directly.
- Delegation hints are **suggestions**, not orders. Main agent owns the
  final routing choice per `notes/SUBAGENT_WORKFLOW.md`.

## Active slices

- `S1_stage1_rebuild.md` - Stage 1 RC v3 packet rebuild (unblocked by Stage 0 GREEN)
- `P3_docs_drift_and_rotation.md` - P2 docs-drift follow-up + rotate landed slices
- `P4_tracker_cleanup.md` - flesh out `BACK-P-06` / `BACK-P-07` + file `assertDetailSettled` blind-spot row

## Landed (not yet rotated)

- `A1b_pressback_harness_fix.md` - landed 2026-04-19 (`9cf405c`);
  flipped Stage 0 GREEN. Rotation by a later cleanup slice.

## Superseded - do not redispatch

- `A1_retry_5560_landscape.md` - prescribed ESC-dismiss approach was
  wrong (ESC keyevent 111 does not close Gboard on modern AVDs).
  A1b's device-level `UiDevice.pressBack()` variant landed GREEN.
  Rotation by a later cleanup slice.

## Cancelled - not dispatched

- `P5_scope_note_landscape_phone.md` - partial-GREEN fallback not
  needed; A1b closed Stage 0 GREEN on 5560 landscape. File retained
  for record.

Rotate (move to `notes/dispatch/completed/` or delete) when a slice
lands. Do not leave stale slice files around - a new dispatcher should
trust that every file here is current.
